# Malicious-URL-Detection-with-Machine-Learning-and-VirusTotal-Integration


This open-source repository hosts a Flask-based web application designed to scan and detect malicious URLs using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques while seamlessly integrating the power of the VirusTotal API. With cyber threats on the rise, this project provides a practical solution to enhance web security and protect users from potentially harmful websites.

>>Key Features:

>Machine Learning-Based Detection: We have implemented cutting-edge machine learning models to analyze URLs and predict their maliciousness. These models have been trained on extensive datasets to ensure high accuracy.

>VirusTotal API Integration: By leveraging the VirusTotal API, our application enhances its capability to assess URLs against multiple antivirus engines, threat indicators, and other security data sources. This collaboration ensures comprehensive URL analysis.

>User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for both technical and non-technical users to perform URL scans and view detailed reports on the results.

>Historical Data and Trends: Our application allows users to track and analyze historical data on scanned URLs, helping to identify patterns and trends in malicious activity.

>Customization: For advanced users, we provide options to fine-tune and customize the machine learning models and scan parameters.

>Security and Privacy: We prioritize the security and privacy of user data, ensuring that all scanned URLs are processed with the utmost care and confidentiality.

>Community Collaboration: We welcome contributions from the open-source community to improve and expand the capabilities of our application.

Protect your organization or personal browsing experience from potential threats by using our powerful Malicious URL Detection application. Get started today and fortify your web security.
